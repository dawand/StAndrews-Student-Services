# StAndrews-Student-Services

I developed this iOS5 app as part of my MSc Thesis titled "St Andrews Student Services on iOS devices" which allowed students to login to the St Andrews MMS system to display their registered modules, timetable, and grades. The app also supported a guest login for public audience to read the University news and events.

Most of the API endpoints have been updated so the student login does not work as it stands. I updated a few RSS URLs of the news and events.
