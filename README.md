# StAndrews-Student-Services

I developed this iOS5 app as part of my MSc Thesis titled "St Andrews Student Services on iOS devices" [**Look at first commit**](https://github.com/dawand/StAndrews-Student-Services/commits/master) which allowed students to login to the St Andrews MMS system to display their registered modules, timetable, and grades. The app also supported a guest login for public audience to read the University news and events.

Most of the API endpoints have been updated so the student login does not work as it stands. I updated some of the RSS URLs of the news and events. You can add other RSS feeds: [University](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/rss/), [Library](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/resources/rss/)
